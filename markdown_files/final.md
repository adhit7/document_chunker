# Welcome

Welcome to the Markdown Uploader! This platform helps you break down markdown files into meaningful pieces for easier viewing and processing.

## How It Works

- Upload your markdown file
- Automatically parse it into chunks
- View each chunk by type

## Chunking Logic

Each section of your markdown will be processed as a chunk. These chunks can be paragraphs, tables, images, or lists.

### Process Overview

| Step   | Description                   |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| Upload | Submit a `.md` file           |
| Parse  | Divide into structured pieces |
| Review | Display content by type       |
